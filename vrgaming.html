      <p class="w3-large">VR gaming is the term used to describe a new generation of computer games with virtual reality (VR) technology that gives players a truly immersive, first-person perspective of game action. Participants both experience and influence the game environment through a variety of VR gaming devices and accessories, including VR headsets, sensor-equipped gloves, hand controllers, and more.</p>
      
      <p class="w3-large w3-hide-medium">VR games can be played on standalone systems, specialized game consoles, or using advanced laptops and PCs that can power the leading VR headsets such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. There are subsets of virtual reality gaming that use related technologies called augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR), where virtual elements are placed into the player's real world as viewed through a headset or camera. Lenovo Explorer uses the Windows Mixed Reality platform which, though still quite VR-focused, introduces new AR and MR experiences.</p>
